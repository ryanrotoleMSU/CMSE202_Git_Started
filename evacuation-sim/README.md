# CMSE 202 Final Project: Forest Fire and Tornado Evacuation Simulation

## üî• Abstract

This project simulates real-time evacuation during two different natural hazards ‚Äî a **forest fire** and a **tornado** ‚Äî in a grid-based town environment. The simulation models the spread of hazards, the reaction of EMS (emergency responders), and evacuation outcomes using emoji-based visualization. Each simulation tracks:
- Hazard spread
- Rescue paths
- Collisions with EMS or houses
- Rescue times
- Destruction logs

We use **NumPy** and **matplotlib** for simulation and visualization. The results help analyze evacuation success and timing under dynamic disaster scenarios.
