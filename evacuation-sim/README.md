# CMSE 202 Final Project: Forest Fire and Tornado Evacuation Simulation

## 🔥 Abstract

This project simulates real-time evacuation during two different natural hazards — a **forest fire** and a **tornado** — in a grid-based town environment. The simulation models the spread of hazards, the reaction of EMS (emergency responders), and evacuation outcomes using emoji-based visualization. Each simulation tracks:
- Hazard spread
- Rescue paths
- Collisions with EMS or houses
- Rescue times
- Destruction logs

We use **NumPy** and **matplotlib** for simulation and visualization. The results help analyze evacuation success and timing under dynamic disaster scenarios.

## ▶️ How to Run

Run from terminal:
```bash
python fire_sim.py
python tornado_sim.py

## 📈 Results

- ✅ Total houses rescued: *X*
- ❌ Total houses destroyed: *Y*
- ⏱️ Average rescue time: *Z minutes*
- 💥 Hazards involved: Fire, Tornado
- 🔁 Rescue collisions handled dynamically

- ⏱️ Simulation steps: 20

### Tornado Simulation
- ✅ Houses rescued before tornado: 6
- ❌ Houses destroyed by tornado: 3
- ⏱️ Max rescue time: 28 minutes
